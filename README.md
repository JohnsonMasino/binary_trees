# 0x1D. C - Binary trees


>>GENERAL
00. What is a binary tree
01. What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
02. What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
03. What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
04. What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
05. What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree


>>REQUIREMENTS
00. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
01. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
02. All your files should end with a new line
03. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
04. Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
05. You are not allowed to use global variables
06. No more than 5 functions per file
07. You are allowed to use the standard library
08. In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
09. The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
10. Don’t forget to push your header file
11. All your header files should be include guarded
